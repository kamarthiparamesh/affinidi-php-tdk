# Affinidi Trust Development Kit (Affinidi TDK)

The Affinidi Trust Development Kit (Affinidi TDK) is a modern interface that allows you to easily manage and integrate [Affinidi Elements](https://www.affinidi.com/product/affinidi-elements) and [Frameworks](https://www.affinidi.com/developer#lota-framework) into your application. It minimises dependencies and enables developers seamless entry into the [Affinidi Trust Network (ATN)](https://www.affinidi.com/get-started).

## How do I use Affinidi TDK?


- Generate Personal access token using command line tool more details [here](https://docs.affinidi.com/dev-tools/affinidi-cli/manage-token/#affinidi-token-create-token) and update .env file with details

```
VAULT_URL="https://vault.affinidi.com"
API_GATEWAY_URL="https://apse1.api.affinidi.io"
TOKEN_ENDPOINT="https://apse1.auth.developer.affinidi.io/auth/oauth2/token"
PROJECT_ID=""
KEY_ID=""
TOKEN_ID=""
PASSPHRASE="" # Optional. Required if private key is encrypted
PRIVATE_KEY=""
```

- Install the PHP TDK Package in your application using below command 
```
composer require affinidi/affinidi-php-tdk
```

- Initiate the Affinidi TDK with config

```
use Affinidi\AffinidiTDK;

$tdk = new AffinidiTDK([
    'api_gateway_url' => $_ENV['API_GATEWAY_URL'],
    'token_endpoint' => $_ENV['TOKEN_ENDPOINT'],
    'project_Id' => $_ENV['PROJECT_ID'],
    'private_key' => $_ENV['PRIVATE_KEY'],
    'token_id' => $_ENV['TOKEN_ID'],
    'passphrase' => $_ENV['PASSPHRASE'],
    'key_id' => $_ENV['KEY_ID'],
    'vault_url' => $_ENV['VAULT_URL'],
]);
```

- Invoke any GET/POST API, for instance

Get all Login configuration list

```
$listConfigs = $tdk->InvokeAPI('/vpa/v1/login/configurations', [], "GET");
echo "List of Configs" . print_r($listConfigs, true);
```

Issuance start API

```
$credentials_request =
    [
        [
            "credentialTypeId" => "SchemaOne",
            "credentialData" => [
                "first_name"=> "FirstName",
                "last_name"=> "LastName",
                "dob"=> "01.01.1970",
            ]
        ]
    ];

$data = $tdk->InvokeAPI('/cis/v1/' . $_ENV['PROJECT_ID'] . '/issuance/start', [
    'data' => $credentials_request,
    'claimMode' => "TX_CODE"
]);

echo "Issuance start response" . print_r($data, true);
```

Initiate Iota redirect data request

```
$data = $tdk->InvokeAPI('/ais/v1/initiate-data-sharing-request', [
    "configurationId" => "0d7acfbb-dcea-4b40-879c-f49fe918ac61", //Iota configuration Id
    "mode" => "redirect",
    "queryId" => "95e639d3-e851-4548-a7c2-be1c2e1b6da1", //Iota Query ID
    "correlationId" => "abc12334-dcea-4b40-879c-f49fe918ac61", // Your app unique id
    "nonce" => "test-nonce1", // nonce id
    "redirectUri" => 'http://localhost:8010/iota',
]);

echo "Issuance start response" . print_r($data, true);
